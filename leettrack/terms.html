        <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions for LeetTrack</h1>
        <p class="updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 15, 2026</p>

        <p>
          By downloading or using the LeetTrack app, these terms will automatically apply to you.
          You should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Important Disclaimer:</strong> LeetTrack is an independent third-party
          application and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by LeetCode. LeetCode
          is a registered trademark of LeetCode LLC.
        </p>

        <h2>Ownership and Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          You're not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in
          any way. You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you
          also shouldn't try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions.
          The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other
          intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Huseyin Cem Ozturk.
        </p>
        <p>
          All LeetCode data, statistics, problem information, and related content displayed in this
          app are the intellectual property of LeetCode LLC. We access this data through LeetCode's
          public API for display purposes only.
        </p>

        <h2>Service Description</h2>
        <p>
          Huseyin Cem Ozturk is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as
          possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge
          for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or
          its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you're paying for.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
          The LeetTrack app stores data locally on your device. This includes your LeetCode username
          and cached statistics from LeetCode's API. It's your responsibility to keep your phone and
          access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your
          phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by
          the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
          malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features and it could
          mean that the LeetTrack app won't work properly or at all.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The app uses third-party services and data sources:</p>

        <h3>LeetCode API</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>LeetTrack fetches publicly available data from LeetCode's platform.</li>
          <li>We have no control over the availability, accuracy, or completeness of LeetCode's API.</li>
          <li>LeetCode may change or discontinue their API at any time.</li>
          <li>Your use of LeetCode's service is subject to LeetCode's own Terms of Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Apple Services</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Push notifications (if enabled)</li>
          <li>WidgetKit for home screen widgets</li>
          <li>App Store for distribution and updates</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Internet Connection Requirement</h2>
        <p>
          You should be aware that there are certain things that Huseyin Cem Ozturk will not take
          responsibility for. The app requires an active internet connection to fetch data from
          LeetCode. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but
          Huseyin Cem Ozturk cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
          functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi or mobile data.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms
          of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
          be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
          while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you're accepting
          responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app
          outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.
        </p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          With respect to Huseyin Cem Ozturk's responsibility for your use of the app, when you're
          using the app, it's important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it
          is updated and correct at all times, we rely on LeetCode to provide accurate data through
          their API.
        </p>
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The app is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind.</li>
          <li>We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any data displayed.</li>
          <li>We do not guarantee that the app will be error-free, uninterrupted, or secure.</li>
          <li>LeetCode statistics and data may be delayed, incorrect, or incomplete.</li>
          <li>Streak calculations are based on LeetCode's public data and may not reflect actual submission times.</li>
          <li>We accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying on the app's data or functionality.</li>
          <li>We are not responsible for any decisions you make based on statistics shown in the app.</li>
          <li>We do not guarantee that the app will meet your specific requirements or expectations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prohibited Uses</h2>
        <p>You agree NOT to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the app for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
          <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app.</li>
          <li>Use automated scripts or bots to access the app.</li>
          <li>Attempt to access LeetCode's API directly through the app in ways that violate their terms.</li>
          <li>Copy, redistribute, or resell any part of the app.</li>
          <li>Remove or modify any copyright, trademark, or proprietary notices.</li>
          <li>Use the app in any way that could damage, disable, or impair the app's functionality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>App Updates and Termination</h2>
        <p>
          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS. The
          requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
          availability of the app to) may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you
          want to keep using the app. Huseyin Cem Ozturk does not promise that it will always
          update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you
          have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
          application when offered to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate the service at any time
          without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
          termination:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end.</li>
          <li>You must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</li>
          <li>All locally stored data will be deleted when you remove the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Accounts and Data</h2>
        <p>
          LeetTrack does not require you to create an account. You simply provide your LeetCode
          username to fetch your public statistics. You are responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensuring your LeetCode username is entered correctly.</li>
          <li>Understanding that your LeetCode profile must be public for the app to work.</li>
          <li>Any actions taken through the app using your LeetCode username.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>
          We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review
          this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the
          new Terms and Conditions on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top.
        </p>
        <p>
          These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page. Your continued
          use of the app after any changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms and Conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms and Conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
          Turkey, and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that
          location.
        </p>

        <h2>Severability</h2>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be unenforceable or invalid,
          that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the
          Terms and Conditions will otherwise remain in full force and effect.
        </p>
